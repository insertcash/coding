<h6 id="achievements">:x Achievements</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Started coding with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)#">:Scratch,</a> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">link here,</a> a kid's coding website, from before I was 8</li>
    <li>Became fluent in Python by the time I was 10.</li>
    <li>Aferward, began learning HTML and building my first website, with considerably good CSS. (unfortunately, the files have been lost.)</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="upcoming">:x Upcoming</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Learn Javascript, to complete my web development skills.</li>
    <li>Learn C, C#, or C++, as they're great for job opportunities and gamedev.</li>
    <li>Learn Go, as it's great for building apps.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="howto">:x Howto</h6>
<p><b>"How did you manage to make these interesting unwrapping links?"</b></p>
<p>I didn't, of course. The neat links are called <a href="https://ncase.me/nutshell/">nutshells,</a> which I'm currently "borrowing indefinitely." Note however that cross-site Nutshell sections rely on the fact that the other site has <a href="https://ncase.me/nutshell/#CORS">:CORS</a> enabled or Nutshell installed.</p>

<blockquote>
    The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time.
    The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.

<p>Of course, 50% of development is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow#">:Stack Overflow,</a> 60% stealing code, (from stack overflow or elsewhere,) 30% on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#">:GitHub,</a> 40% staring at your IDE, and -20% getting your code to work first try.</p>
